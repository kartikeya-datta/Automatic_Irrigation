## Introduction

Efficient water management is crucial for sustainable agriculture. This project aims to develop an automatic irrigation system that uses real-time sensor data (e.g., soil moisture, temperature, humidity) to determine the optimal irrigation schedule. By automating the irrigation process, we can minimize water waste, improve crop yield, and reduce labor costs.

## Features

- **Real-time Sensor Monitoring:** Collects and processes data from soil moisture, temperature, and humidity sensors.
- **Automated Irrigation Control:** Triggers irrigation based on predefined thresholds and machine learning predictions.
- **Data Logging:** Stores sensor data for analysis and model training.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Uses machine learning models to predict soil moisture and optimize irrigation schedules.
- **User-Friendly Interface (Optional):** Provides a dashboard or mobile app to monitor and control the system. (Note: This might be a future enhancement or separate project, depending on the scope).

## Hardware Components

- **Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi):** Processes sensor data and controls the irrigation system.
- **Soil Moisture Sensor:** Measures the moisture content of the soil.
- **Temperature and Humidity Sensor (e.g., DHT11, DHT22):** Measures ambient temperature and humidity.
- **Water Pump:** Delivers water to the crops.
- **Relay Module:** Switches the water pump on and off based on the microcontroller's signal.
- **Power Supply:** Provides power to the system.
- **Wiring and Connectors:** Connects the components together.

## Software Components

- **Microcontroller Firmware:** Code for reading sensor data and controlling the irrigation system.
- **Data Logging Script:** Script for storing sensor data in a database or file.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Code for training and deploying the machine learning model.
- **(Optional) User Interface:** Web or mobile application for monitoring and controlling the system.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/kartikeya-datta/Automatic_Irrigation.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/kartikeya-datta/Automatic_Irrigation.git)
   cd Automatic_Irrigation
Install Required Libraries:

For the microcontroller firmware, install the necessary libraries for your microcontroller platform (e.g., Arduino IDE libraries).
For the data logging and machine learning scripts, install the required Python packages using pip:
Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Connect Hardware Components:

Follow the wiring diagram provided in the repository to connect the sensors, relay module, and water pump to the microcontroller.
Upload Firmware to Microcontroller:

Open the microcontroller firmware in the Arduino IDE (or your platform's IDE) and upload it to the microcontroller.
Set Up Data Logging:

Configure the data logging script to store sensor data in your preferred format (e.g., CSV, database).
Train the Machine Learning Model (Optional):

If you want to use machine learning for irrigation optimization, collect sensor data for a period of time and train the model using the provided scripts.
Usage
Power On the System:

Connect the power supply to the system.
Monitor Sensor Data:

Observe the sensor readings through the microcontroller's serial monitor or the data logging output.
Automatic Irrigation:

The system will automatically trigger irrigation when the soil moisture level falls below the predefined threshold or based on the machine learning model's prediction.
Manual Control (Optional):

If a user interface is implemented, use it to manually control the irrigation system.
Data Collection
Collect sensor data (soil moisture, temperature, humidity) at regular intervals.
Store the data in a structured format (e.g., CSV, database).
Ensure the data is labeled with the corresponding irrigation actions (if applicable).
Use the collected data to train and evaluate the machine learning model.
Machine Learning Model
The repository may include pre-trained machine learning models or scripts for training your own models.
The model can be used to predict soil moisture levels or optimize irrigation schedules.
Consider using algorithms such as regression (e.g., linear regression, polynomial regression) or time series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) depending on the complexity of your data and requirements.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared).
